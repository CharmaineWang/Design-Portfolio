            <div class="project_page_content">
                <h2>Background</h2>
                
                <p>Horizn, dedicated to providing employee and customer learning platforms, helps gamify the learning experience through client provided learning assets and prizes that users may redeem for. Motorola, one of Horizn’s clients, utilizes a rewards systems implemented into a digital platform called "Moto Rewards" created by Horizn. The website educates users about old and new products through informative activities such as interactive powerpoints, infographics and videos. Within the program, Users can earn points by completing each learning activity and then redeem the points for eligible rewards. Horizn is responsible for designing a seemless redemption process to ensure users are satisfied throughout the learning experience and return for more educational contents to increase engagement.</p>
                
                <h2>Problem Space</h2>
                
                <p>The existing user interface and experience displayed major flaws within the system, which caused confusion amongst users throughout the redemption process.</p>
                
                <br><p>Here were some of the problems with the existing system:<br> -  Lack of transparency between users and their redemption<br> -  The shipping details section is too hidden <br> -  Users forget to update their shipment addresses <br> -  Site needs to incorporate a W9 form into the user flow</p>
                
                <h2>Problem Details</h2>
                
                <h3>User Flow Design Flaws</h3>
                
                <p>Products that were out of the user’s points range, were grayed out and thus, indicating that it was not available for redemption. Firstly, “Product Details” pages were only available to users when they had enough points to redeem for that product. The “Product Details” page contained full descriptions and available selections of a product which gave users more insight to the reward. This decision was initially made with the belief that users would be more inclined to earn points in order to unveil each product description. However, users were more reluctant to earn points and only redeemed for low point products between the range 110 to 1230 points. This approach failed to encourage users to redeem for higher point products, which led to a redemption rate lower than expected.</p>
                
                
                <p>Secondly, the lack of transparency on the website drove numerous support cases as users were concerned about their products. Not only were users hesitant about redeeming future products, but this problem also took time away from the customer success team.</p>
                
                <p>Lastly, the shipping details was originally placed under the user's profile so they would only need to fill in their shipping details once. This approach was meant to make the redemption process shorter but over time, Horizn’s customer success team realized that user’s redeemed rewards were expiring due to forgetting to fill out the shipment details. Additionally, users with a new shipping address were not reminded to update their shipping address nor were they directed to the “Shipping Detatils” tab after filling it out once. This raised a lot of issues for the customer success staff as more expired use cases and complaints about changing shipping addresses were brought up throughout the year.</p>
                
                <h3>W9 form requirements</h3>
                
                <p>The W9 form, formally known as the Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, is an income tax system used in the United States and filed by a third party. The requirement stated that once the user reached $600 in their year to date total, the user must submit the W9 to the government in order to redeem for future rewards through the website. To meet this need, Horizn must update the rewards redemption flow to ensure that user can select a prize or reward and be informed if they’ve met the $600 threshold.</p>
                
                <p>A second requirement was to ensure that users that have either met or exceeded the $600 threshold must sign a W9 Form prior to redeeming for any additional products.</p>
                
                <h2>Market Research</h2>
                
                <p>To fulfill the need of providing a streamlined and transparent redemption experience for all users, user experience research was conducted to analyze how existing platforms currently handles product order, shipment, and status. Upon research, products similar to the Moto Insiders platform were not available, thus, a comparative analysis was conducted on a few selected e-commerce sites. Since the “Moto Rewards” and “Learn and Earn” standard redemption flows are comparable to common online shop- ping experiences, 5 e-commerce sites were studied for feature analysis.</p>

                <p  style="margin-top: 5%">To summarize the findings, standard e-commerce sites included the 3 following features as part of a user’s purchase experience: <br> - entering shipping address was part of each checkout process <br> - the confirmation page reminded users that they would receive order updates through emails while directed users to the order history page <br> - an “Order History” page provided users visibility to the statuses of their products <br><br> All these features did not exist on the MotorolaInsiders site due to previously determined design decisions along with the lack of the W9 requirement.</p>
                
                <h2>Design Principle and System</h2>
                
                <p>To analyze the functionality and compare the new design with the original design, a set of design principles was chosen to follow. The discussed result was to follow Don Norman’s Design Principles. Norman outlines 6 core principles of design: visibility, feedback, affordance, mapping, constraints, and consistency. Norman challenged designers to craft designs such as devices, computers, interfaces and everyday things to be intuitive, easy to use and functional; since MotorolaInsiders was lacking basic usability and intuitiveness, this set of principles was chosen to analyze design decision.</p>
                
                <p>For the purpose of the new enhancement, the 6 principles were broken down and each assigned a weighing system to analyze the new design as detailed in Table 2.</p>

                <h3>Rewards Page Consistency</h3>
                
                <p>The “Product Details” page is not available for all products, providing an unsatisfying experience for users who can’t view certain products. When evaluating the current design based on Norman’s Design Principles, consistency was one of the principles that had to be enforced on the “Rewards” page. The “Rewards” page displays all the available products for redemption with the product image, product name, and product points value. To tackle this problem, the greyed out feature for products users cannot redeem for was removed. This solution was originally design considering a scenario where a user redeemed for a product, their available rewards points post redemption may reach below the price of that product, thus not allowing them to view the product again.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5%">Another area that required setting consistency across the platform was the shipping address requirement section. Previously, users were directed to the “Shipping Details” tab under their profile page to fill out their shipping details. Because this requirement wasn’t enforced on the users, they were not receiving their products sooner than they could be. The researched e-commerce sites consistently requested users to fill out their shipment details or to choose an existing address for every order. As a result, it was decided to incorporate the shipment detail request as part of a user’s redemption process. The decision was made because it allowed consistency across the page by requesting for the shipping details during every redemption. This decision resolved the issue by only directing users to the “Shipping Details” tab when the information is still absent.</p>

                <p>Due to the removal of the greyed out feature, another method had to be integrated to set constraints and limit the interaction of redeeming for a product beyond the user’s points range. To offset the removed feature, once the user arrives on the “Product Details” page, if the product’s price was beyond the user’s available rewards points, the “Redeem” button would be greyed out and not selectable. This decision was made to limit the user’s range of interaction possibilities, preventing them from going beyond this step through a simple interface. By greying out the button, not only does it restrict users from redeeming that product, the feature itself has high affordance as it clearly illustrates the idea of not allowing to redeem it to the users.</p>

                <h2>W9 Form Requirement Feature</h2>
                <p>Norman’s Design Principle, Feedback, was a key component to the process of incorporating the W9 Requirement form. As the W9 form is considered to be a serious task a user must complete, a popup was designed as a form of feedback to inform a user about this requirement. Popups are known as secondary windows that pops up upon a trigger from the parent window the user was currently visiting. Popups stop visitors from interacting with the parent window until they complete a certain action. In this scenario, when a user is about to reach $600 for their year to date total value, they require a form of feedback that informs them about the next steps prior to redeeming for that product. By using a popup, a summary of the reasoning behind signing the form can be explained on the popup, thus providing users with information about what has been accomplished or completed.</p>

                <p><p>The original site did not provide any visibility to a redeemed product’s status. The only existing form of communication was through email, which were only sent after the user redeemed for the product, when the product gets rejected or when the product gets shipped. The lack of having a central system to monitor all redeemed products was inconvenient and heavily concerned users. The solution was to add a “Prize” tab under the user’s profile page so that users could view their redemption statuses.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5%" >Since the “Prize” tab was a one-page solution, users would have to scroll if they had acquired multiple redemptions. The vertical scrollbar was implemented onto the page to not only maintain consistency since it used across the entire platform, but it was also an application of Norma’s principle, mapping. As users scrolled down the “Prize” tab, the vertical scrollbar followed the action at the same rate, thus effectively mapped control and effect closely together.</p>
                
                <h2>Results</h2>
                
                <p>After the deployment of these new enhancements, the site was monitored for 3 months consecutively and Horizn’s monthly reports reported significant growth in user traf- ficking rate. Users felt more encouraged to complete learning activities, which led to an increase in processed redemptions. Additionally, the customer success team was receiving fewer shipment support cases, instead, received positive feedback about the new user experience from users.</p>
                
                <p>The goal of this enhancement was to integrate the W9 form requirement and to provide a standard and better user redemption flow to the “Moto Rewards” pro- gram. From the analysis in the report body, it was concluded that Horizn was able to successfully update the standard redemption flow and integrate the new W9 form requirement. All 6 of Norman’s design principles were applied throughout the implementation, which satisfied the client’s requests and led to the site’s success.</p>
