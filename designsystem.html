                <p><br>During winter 2019, I interned at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), specifically the mobile team as a visual designer. Although “visual designer” was my title, I was very fortunate to have faced a variety of design challenges from product to design system to media production.

                <br><br>One of the main responsibilities I had was to improve the mobile team’s internal design system. I worked closely with the design and development team to design a flexible documentation style that can be used over time to ensure product consistency, future maintainability and scalability.

                <br><br>I was also a designer on the SMB (Small Business team within Mobile), focusing on the experience of our mobile banking users who owned their own businesses. Although I can’t share much of what I did on this team, feel free to reach out to me with any questions about my work on SMB!</p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-designsys/team.png">
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Background</h2>
                
                <p>To give a little more context to the Mobile team’s history with design systems, when I joined, the team was in the process of migrating from Sketch + Zeplin to just Figma. The SMB team was the first team (within mobile) to try out Figma just to test out the water as it seemed like a better tool for collaboration amongst designers and developers. During the migration, Figma launched features related to the Design System so we took the opportunity to reconstruct our existing design system.</p>
                
                
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                
                <p>The main problem with our existing design tools is the insufficiency from design to development handoff and the lack of product consistency. 
                <br><br>Below is an example of what part of our design system looked like on Sketch. Each component has a name and is categorized with similar components. However, the lack of documentation for these components generated confusion amongst designers as they weren’t given enough context as to when/how to use them. Although different states of a component were listed, developers still found it hard to understand the interactions between different states and didn’t know how individual parts of a component would scale between a smaller and a larger screen.</p>
                
        
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">

                </div>
                
                <p>To summarize, here’s a list of challenges designers and developers faced day-to-day:
                </p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">

                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Since there are 5 sub-teams within the mobile team, having a well-structured design system can really help the product develop overtime.</p>
                
                
                <h2>Product Goal</h2>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">

                </div>
                
                <h2>Understanding Design Systems</h2>
                
                <p>Since this was my first time help build a design system, I chatted with Brad our product design lead (also my mentor) and did some research to wrap my head around design systems.

                    <br><br>I started with a quick read of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intuit.com/ca/" style="color:#3E895C;"><b>Design System Handbook</b></a> by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intuit.com/ca/" style="color:#EA3465;"><b>DesignBetter</b></a> and learned that having a scalable design system not only allows teams to design consistently, it also allows for faster prototyping and iterations, improve usability, allow the team to scale and build accessible products. These findings really helped me appreciate the impact a well-structured design system can make on teams and helped me understand how it can help solve our problems at RBC.

                  <br><br>I’ve used design systems such as Material Design and Apple Human Interface Guidelines in the past as a guide when designing for Android and iOS products. While they are indeed powerful and informative, the Mobile team was looking for something that was a bit more detailed. While coming up with a solution for our own design system, I referenced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intuit.com/ca/" style="color:#9EBD59;"><b>Shopify Polaris</b></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intuit.com/ca/" style="color:#1C48A0;"><b>Atlassian Design System</b></a> as both seem to have the level of detail we were looking for at RBC.</p>
                
                <h2>Features</h2>
                
                <p>The intended users for this design system were both designers and developers. From conversations and short interviews conducted by the team prior to my joining, here’s a list of highly requested features from the team members:</p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-designsys/needs.png">
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>I specifically explored the component structure and variations & states.</p>
                
                <h2>Initial Design</h2>
                
                <p>Since designers could simply drag or copy and paste components onto their screen in Figma, the initial thought of documenting the components was to utilize development language. The hypothesis was that using words such as “enum”, “boolean”, “true” and “false” would make it easier for developers to understand how to build certain components.</p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-designsys/first_design.png">
                        <p class="image_description">First iteration of documenting the structure and states of the component</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Although the RBC banking app can be used on both phones and tablets, designers only design for mobile which means there’s a lot of back and forth communication between developers and designers for tablet versions. 
                    
                <br><br>To solve that problem, we started by laying out paddings and margins for each part of the component and showcased how they would react when stacked or enlarged. Additionally, we specified maximum dimensions demonstrating the component’s constraints.
                </p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-designsys/vs_first.png">
                        <p class="image_description">Examples of what the component looks like in various situations</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Self and Team Testing</h2>
                
                <p>Due to the nature of an internal tool, the best way to test this product was for our team members to interact with the design system and talk through their experiences. This included trying to design screens using documented components and document new components. 

                <br><br>While I tried it myself and asked other people to use it, I made sure to look out for several things. For the purpose of using the design system, I thought about:
                  <br>- How was the component used
                  <br>- Were the constraints flexible and easily understood
                 <br> - Was the component documentation easy to follow

                <br><br>And to understand how approachable the documentation style is, I observed the following:
                 <br> - How long did it take to document a new component
                 <br> - Were they able to document everything they needed
                 <br> - Where did the designer get stuck on
                </p>
                
                <h2>Observations</h2>
                
                <p>After a few rounds of trying to use the design system and documenting new components, we quickly realized that most designers on the team don’t have a coding background and so this language of variables and data type made it difficult to understand and document. We’d basically have to teach everyone on the team how to code before onboarding everyone to this framework.

                <br><br>Another realization I had was although the Layout section provided different scenarios components usage along with its constraints, it still lacked detail in terms of how each part of a component would respond to screen sizes.

                <br><br>As a member of the team, I wanted to ensure that the documentation style is easily replicable and understood so that current designers can understand and document components at a faster rate while future hires can easily onboard.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Result</h2>
                
                <p>After a few rounds of iterating, I landed with a documentation style that was straight forward and can be applied to any component. 

                <br><br>Here are the key features of the final design:
                <br>1) Each component is broken down into smaller parts that are labelled to help distinguish them.
                <br>2) I showcased how to build the component using each part by using examples showing how the parts interact with one another
                <br>3) I decided to forgo the techy terms and simply use words and sentences to explain the constraints.
                </p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-designsys/result.png">
                        <p class="image_description">A component broken down to three parts with a description on how each part scales</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Learnings and Reflections</h2>
                
                <p>One of the big takeaways I gained from this experience was the importance of having a functional design system. Design systems not only define quality and consistency across a product, but it also provides designers with the confidence and time to focus on solving user problems by abstracting away many ambiguities. I find that nowadays, it’s hard to design without the thought of having a good design system 😅.

                <br><br>Another thing I learned is that designers solve problems, which can range from consumer facing products to internal tools. This was my first time designing for an internal use case which meant there was a smaller user group. However, it was important to keep in mind of future users and design for scalability.

                <br><br>Looking back, I’d love to involve PMs, accessibility experts, content writers and more developers throughout the process. I think it would’ve been beneficial for everybody aside from solely designers to understand the value and importance of having a design system.

                <br><br>Given the structure of large companies, designers were seated together on one side of the floor and developers sat on the other side. Although I loved being surrounded by a team of designers, I felt pretty isolated from the developers and  would’ve loved more interaction with them.
