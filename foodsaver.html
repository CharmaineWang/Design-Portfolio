                <h2>Background</h2>
                
                <p>As a believer in creating a more sustainable environment for the future, I try my best to be mindful with the amount of food waste I produce. It is so easy nowadays to over purchase an unnecessary amount of groceries that easily leads to being tossed away due to being forgotten or unwanted. Most recent studies show that about 275 kg of food (values at $1,500) is wasted by the average single-family household in Toronto. The environmental impact of food waste stems from greenhouse gases that result from its preparation and decomposition, which results in a methane production greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. This is not only methane as a result of the food waste, but includes the methane emitted throughout the process of growing, processing and transporting the food.</p>
                
                <p>I decided to challenge myself and take on the role of designing an application to help minimize food waste in our everyday lives.</p>
                
                
                <h2> Design Goals</h2>
                
                <p>I decided to approach this problem by designing a product that not only prevents users from over purchasing food but also encourages them to utilize what is already in their fridge. By generating a list of recipes that are easily accessible and combine ingredients users already have in their home, it encourages them to not waste food and be creative in the kitchen. This app will empower users by allowing them to complete a recipe from end to end while keeping them happy by not producing large sums of food waste.</p>
                
                <h2>Understanding Users</h2>
                
                <p>I began the project by conducting user research and asked the following questions: <br><br>- How often do you throw away food? <br>- Why do you throw away food? What causes you to over purchase? <br>- What type of food do you throw away the most? <br><br>The results demonstrated that peopl throw away food almost every week! Most people throw away produce because they don’t know what to do with what is left after a certain recipe. People tend to over purchase because they forget what is home and sometimes they make lists to buy groceries on the fly, which eliminates the process of checking what’s in their fridge.</p>
                
                <h2>Focus</h2>
                
                <p>The product I designed focuses on 3 key features: <br><br>- Viewing what items are in the fridge along with their expected expiration dates <br>- Creating a shopping list <br>- Providing recipes that utilizes ingredients they have 
                </p>
                
               <h2>User Flow</h2>
                <p>With the key features decided, I proceeded to map out the user eperience utilizing hierarchical task analysis. </p>

                <p>In the app, users may explore recipe options that utilizes existing ingredients in their fridge. These recipe list will be optimized so that they are in the order based off of the number of ingredients the users own. The more ingredients coming from the user’s list, the further up it will be displayed on the recipe list. Each recipe page will highlight the ingredients that users already have and allow users to add missing ingredients to their shopping list. This way, not only will the users know exactly how much of an ingredient they need to purchase, they can also clean their fridge by using existing items for the dish.<br><br>The “Fridge” page displays all the ingredients that the user has at home. These items are added from the user’s completed shopping lists or can be added manually from the user.  Each item will have the amount left displayed along with their expected expiration date. Users may utilize this list when they go shopping without a list so they can have an overview of what is in their fridge and prevent buying duplicate items.</p>
