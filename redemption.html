                <h2>Background</h2>
                
                <p>Horizn, dedicated to providing employee and customer learning platforms, helps gamify the learning experience through client provided learning assets and prizes that users may redeem for. Motorola, one of Horizn’s clients, utilizes a rewards systems implemented into a digital platform called "Moto Rewards" created by Horizn. The website educates users about old and new products through informative activities such as interactive powerpoints, infographics and videos. Within the program, Users can earn points by completing each learning activity and then redeem the points for eligible rewards. Horizn is responsible for designing a seamless redemption process to ensure users are satisfied throughout the learning experience and return for more educational contents to increase engagement.</p>
                
                
                <h2>My Role</h2>
                
                <p>As a product manager at Horizn, I worked in a team of 2 product managers (including me), 3 developers and a designer. I worked closely with our customer success team on collecting and analyzing data to figure out usage patterns along with user demographic, ran whiteboarding sessions with the designer to ideate solutions, and communicated design values, business vision and technicalities with the engineering team.</p>
                
        
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-redemption/PM.png">
                            <p class="image_description">How I felt being a PM</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Problem Space</h2>
                
                <p>From collecting and analyzing data on the website usage pattern, we noticed that many users had enough points to redeem prizes but the points weren’t being used. Additionally, our customer care team were receiving countless calls and emails with various questions about their redemptions.
                <br><br>Our assumption was that the user interface and experience displayed major flaws within the system, causing confusion thus not providing our users with the confidence to go through the redemption process.
                <br><br>Here were some of the problems with the existing system:

                <br>- Lack of transparency between users and their redemption
                <br>- Users forget to input/update their shipment addresses
                <br>- Site needs to incorporate a W9 form into the user flow
                </p>
                
                <h2>Product Journey</h2>
                
                <p>To help me empathize with the users, I went through the product myself and also asked Lesley (Product Director and my mentor) to walk through and explain the existing user journey to me. I looked at the user journey and highlighted several pain points.

                <br><br><b>Browse</b>: user is restricted to only viewing products within their points.
                <br><b>Redeem</b>: user is not asked to fill out their shipping info when redeeming for the first time
                <br><b>Stand by</b>: user is waiting for their prize to arrive, but don’t know how long it’s going to take
                <br><b>Receive email reminder</b>: user is reminded to log onto the site to fill out their shipping detail. User find the email annoying, may ignore it
                <br><b>Fille out details</b>: logs onto the website, unsure where the shipping details page is
                <br><b>Call/email support</b>: contacts customer support to help them fill out the necessary information</p>
                
                <h2>User Research</h2>
                
                <p>To validate my hypotheses, I chatted with our customer support team and took a look at the product's usage data.
                <br><br>From our customer calls and emails, we received a lot of questions like these:</p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-redemption/bubbles.png">
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>It was clear that users found it difficult to find important features, specifically the shipping details page which led to a lot of hesitations and reluctance to redeeming for more prizes.

                <br><br>By looking at the usage pattern, we noticed that most users redeemed for low point products that ranged between 110 to 1230 points. On the product page, products that were out of the user’s points range were grayed out and thus, indicating that it was not available for redemption. “Product Details” pages contains full descriptions and available selections of a product which would give users more insight to the reward. This decision was initially made with the belief that users would be more inclined to earn points in order to unveil each product description. However, the data showed that users were more reluctant to save for those more “expensive” products. Our hypothesis was that users didn’t want to save up for something they had no transparency to.</p>
                
                <h2>Product Requirements</h2>
                
                <p>The goal of our product was to encourage learning engagement, but the process of redeeming prizes made it so complex that users didn’t find motivation to complete those learning activities.
                <br><br>For this enhancement, we needed to fulfill the following product requirements:
                <br>- Minimize confusion by improving transparency between users and their redemptions
                <br>- Make products more visible to encourage elearning completions
                <br>- Include the W9 user experience to align with meet tax requirements
                </p>
                
                <h2>Market Research</h2>
                
                <p>To fulfill the need of providing a streamlined and transparent redemption experience for all users, user experience research was conducted to analyze how existing platforms currently handles product order, shipment, and status. Since the “Moto Rewards” and “Learn and Earn” standard redemption flows are comparable to common online shop- ping experiences, 5 e-commerce sites were studied for feature analysis.</p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-redemption/market.png">
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>To summarize the findings, standard e-commerce sites included the 3 following features as part of a user’s purchase experience:
                <br>- entering/selecting shipping address was part of each checkout process
                <br>- the confirmation page reminded users that they would receive order updates through emails while directed users to the order history page
                <br>- an “Order History” page provides users visibility to the statuses of their products

                <br><br>All these features did not exist on the MotorolaInsiders site due to previously determined design decisions along with the lack of the W9 requirement.</p>
                
                <h2>Feature Implementation</h2>
                
                <p>The “Product Details” page is not available for all products, providing an unsatisfying experience for users who can’t view certain products. The “Rewards” page displays all the available products for redemption with the product image, product name, and product points value. To tackle this problem, we decided to allow users to click into each product and view all “Product Details” pages. </p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-redemption/pattern.png">
                        <p class="image_description">Existing to enhanced rewards page pattern</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Due to the removal of the greyed out feature, another method had to be integrated to set constraints and limit the interaction of redeeming for a product beyond the user’s points range. To offset the removed feature, once the user arrives on the “Product Details” page, if the product’s price was beyond the user’s available rewards points, the “Redeem” button would be greyed out and not selectable. This decision was made to limit the user’s range of interaction possibilities, preventing them from going beyond this step through a simple interface. By greying out the button, not only does it restrict users from redeeming that product, the feature itself has high affordance as it clearly illustrates the idea of not allowing to redeem it to the users.</p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-redemption/redeem.png">
                        <p class="image_description">a) The "Redeem" button is greyed out and user can not select the button
                            <br>b)The “Redeem” button is in its regular color, indicating the product is redeemable</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Previously, users were directed to the “Shipping Details” tab under their profile page to fill out their shipping details. Because this requirement wasn’t enforced on the users during the redemption process, users didn’t know where to fill out their address or that they even needed to. The researched e-commerce sites consistently requested users to fill out their shipment details or to choose an existing address for every order. As a result, it was decided to incorporate the shipment detail request as part of a user’s redemption process. </p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-redemption/shipping.png">
                        <p class="image_description">“Shipping Info” requesting users to enter their shipping detail for every redemption.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                
                <p>The original site did not provide any visibility to a redeemed product’s status. The only existing form of communication was through email, which were only sent after the user redeemed for the product, when the product gets rejected or when the product gets shipped. The lack of having a central system to monitor all redeemed products was inconvenient and heavily concerned users. The solution was to add a “Prize” tab under the user’s profile page so that users could view their redemption statuses.</p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-redemption/status.png">
                        <p class="image_description">Prizes page to track shipment status</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Feedback was a key component to the process of incorporating the W9 Requirement form. As the W9 form is considered to be a serious task a user must complete, a popup was designed as a form of feedback to inform a user about this requirement. Popups are known as secondary windows that pops up upon a trigger from the parent window the user was currently visiting. Popups stop visitors from interacting with the parent window until they complete a certain action. In this scenario, when a user is about to reach $600 for their year to date total value, they require a form of feedback that informs them about the next steps prior to redeeming for that product. By using a popup, a summary of the reasoning behind signing the form can be explained on the popup, thus providing users with information about what has been accomplished or completed.</p>
                
                <div class="project_page_image"  style="background-color: white;">
                    <div class="demo_image_row row">
                            <img class="demo_image" src="assets/img/project-redemption/W9.png">
                        <p class="image_description">User receives an attention popup when they are required to sign a W9 form.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Results</h2>
                
                <p>After the deployment of these new enhancements, the site was monitored for 3 months consecutively and Horizn’s monthly reports reported significant growth in user trafficking rate. We were seeing in increase in redemptions of more “expensive” products that were previously available on the site. Additionally, the customer success team was receiving fewer shipment support cases.

                <br><br>Various features have been carried forward to other company platforms beyond Motorola to instill product consistency and ease of usability.</p>
                
                <h2>Reflections</h2>
                
                <p>This was my first time working as a product manager, since Horizn was a relatively small start up at the time I interned, I was able to wear a lot of hats and given various learning opportunities. Being a product manager means cross functional communication with multiple teams from design, to customer success, and to the engineering team. Overlooking data is a daily practice, this project really taught me how to make and communicate decision driven by data to my team.</p>
